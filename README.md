## ðŸš€ Setup & Deployment (For 15-Year-Olds!)

### Step 1: Firebase Setup

1. Your Firebase project is already created! The name is "isbmun-dashboard"
2. Make sure these services are enabled in the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/):
   - Authentication (click on "Authentication" in the sidebar and enable Email/Password provider)
   - Firestore Database (click on "Firestore Database" and create a database in production mode)
   - Realtime Database (click on "Realtime Database" and create a database)

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Go to the Firebase console and click on "Authentication"
2. Click on "Add User" and create accounts based on these formats:
   - Chair accounts: `chair-COUNCILNAME@isbmun.com` (e.g., chair-ecosoc@isbmun.com)
   - Admin accounts: `admin-NAME@isbmun.com` or `admin@isbmun.com` if no name
   - Press accounts: `press-NAME@isbmun.com` or `press@isbmun.com` if no name
3. Set their passwords

The system automatically recognizes:
- Emails starting with "chair-" as chair accounts (with council name extracted from email)
- Emails starting with "admin-" or "admin" as admin accounts (with name extracted if available)
- Emails starting with "press-" or "press" as press accounts (with name extracted if available)

### Step 3: Firebase Rules Setup

1. Go to the Firebase console and click on "Firestore Database"
2. Click on the "Rules" tab and replace the rules with:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to authenticated users
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow chairs to update only their own council data
    match /councils/{councilId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin' ||
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.council == resource.data.name);
    }
    
    // Allow users to create and update their own user data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == userId || 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin');
    }
    
    // Only admins can create or delete documents
    match /documents/{docId} {
      allow create, delete: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Allow both chairs and admins to create alerts
    match /alerts/{alertId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Now go to "Realtime Database" and click on the "Rules" tab, then replace the rules with:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "councilStatus": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      "$councilId": {
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    },
    "alerts": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    },
    "timers": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      "$timerId": {
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    },
    "DIRECT_MESSAGES": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click "Publish" on both rule sets!

### Step 4: Set Up Timer Sounds

For the timer notification sounds to work correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Upload Sound Files to Firebase Storage:**
   - Go to Firebase Console â†’ Storage
   - Create a new bucket if you don't have one
   - Upload your timer sound files (MP3 format is recommended)
   - Make the files publicly accessible by clicking on the file â†’ Permissions â†’ Add a new principal â†’ allUsers â†’ Role: Storage Object Viewer

2. **Get the Public URLs:**
   - After uploading, click on each sound file
   - Copy the "Public URL" from the file details panel

3. **Alternative Method: Use Local Sound Files:**
   - You can also place sound files directly in the `/public` folder of your project
   - The QuickTimerWidget is configured to use `/notification.mp3` from the public folder
   - Simply replace this file with your preferred sound, keeping the same filename

4. **Recommended Sound Files:**
   - Timer completion sound: A clear alarm sound (5-10 seconds)
   - Alert notification sound: A short notification sound (1-2 seconds)

With these steps, the timer sounds will work reliably across all browsers and devices.

### Step 5: Customizing Quick Actions in Chair Dashboard

To modify the quick action buttons that appear in the Chair Dashboard:

1. **Open the ChairDashboard.tsx file** located at `src/pages/ChairDashboard.tsx`

2. **Locate the Quick Actions section** (around line 120) that looks like this:
   ```jsx
   <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
     <AlertButton
       icon={<Wrench size={24} />}
       label="IT Support"
       onClick={() => handleAlert('IT Support')}
       loading={loadingAlert === 'IT Support'}
     />
     // Other alert buttons...
   </div>
   ```

3. **To add a new alert button**:
   - Copy an existing AlertButton component
   - Change the icon, label, and alert type
   - Import any new icons at the top of the file:
     ```jsx
     import { Wrench, MessagesSquare, Truck, AlertTriangle, Send, MessageSquare, YourNewIcon } from 'lucide-react';
     ```

4. **To modify an existing alert button**:
   - Change the icon, label, or alert type as needed
   - For urgent alerts, add the `variant="urgent"` prop

5. **To remove an alert button**:
   - Simply delete the entire AlertButton component

6. **If you need to modify what happens when alerts are sent**, locate the `handleAlert` function (around line 70) and update the messaging or priority logic.

These customizations don't require any backend changes, as the alert system is already set up to handle custom alert types.

### Step 6: Deploy to Vercel (Super Easy!)

1. Create a Vercel account if you don't have one: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
3. In your project folder, run: `vercel login`
4. Then run: `vercel`
5. Follow the prompts (mostly just press Enter for the default options)
6. Your app is deployed! ðŸŽ‰

## Using Email-Based Role Recognition

This app uses a special system to determine user roles based on email addresses:

### Chair Accounts
- Format: `chair-COUNCILNAME@isbmun.com`
- Example: `chair-ecosoc@isbmun.com`
- The app automatically extracts "ECOSOC" as the council name
- Chair users can only send alerts from their assigned council

### Admin Accounts
- Format: `admin-NAME@isbmun.com` or `admin@isbmun.com`
- Example: `admin-john@isbmun.com`
- Admins can see and manage all councils, alerts, and users
- Name is extracted and capitalized for display if provided

### Press Accounts
- Format: `press-NAME@isbmun.com` or `press@isbmun.com`
- Example: `press-sarah@isbmun.com`
- Press users have similar access to chairs but are assigned to the "PRESS" council
- Name is extracted and capitalized for display if provided

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't Log In" Problems
- Make sure you've enabled Email/Password authentication in Firebase
- Check if you're using the correct email format (chair-councilname@isbmun.com or admin-name@isbmun.com)
- Make sure the account exists in Firebase Authentication
- Try using the demo accounts if nothing else works

### "No Councils Showing" Problems
- Councils are automatically created when chair users log in
- Make sure chair emails follow the format `chair-COUNCILNAME@isbmun.com`
- Check your Firebase rules to make sure they allow reading/writing

### "No Real-time Updates" Problems
- Check your Firebase rules to make sure they allow reading/writing
- Make sure `VITE_FIREBASE_DEMO_MODE` is set to `false`
- Check the browser console for errors (press F12 to open developer tools)

### "Timer Sounds Not Working" Problems
- Check if your browser allows autoplay of audio
- Make sure the sound file URLs are accessible
- Try using a different sound file format (MP3 is most compatible)
- Check the browser console for any errors related to audio playback

### "Deployment Failed" Problems
- Make sure all environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
- Try running `vercel --prod` to force a production build
